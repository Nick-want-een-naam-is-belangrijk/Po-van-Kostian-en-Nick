    <p><h1>Welkom to the calculator game information page.</h1></p>
	<p><b>The calculator game is a simple but interesting game about a cube that tries to make it
	to the finish. It sounds easy, but then you come across levels with water and hazards
	which kill you. By jumping over hazards and going through water, you can make it to the
	end. Still think its easy? Install the game on your calculator and try it for yourself.
	The only things you need are: a graphing calculator, a steady hand and a lot of
	patience. Can you do it?</b></p>

	<p><h3>Controls</h3></p>
	<p>Before you can play the game, you need to know the controls. Otherwise
	you will get stuck in the first level (imagen). To move right you need
	to press 6. To go left you need to press 4. To jump 8 is the right
	button. This seems random, but these buttons are on the same places as 
	W, A and D are (you can see it on the right).
	<br><br>
	Now you know how you move, how do you move in water? It is pretty
	simple. If you hold 8 you go up. If you reach the top of the water you 
	jump like normal. You fall with the same speed in water as if your just
	in the air.
